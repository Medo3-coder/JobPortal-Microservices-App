/*

What is elasticSearchClient.cluster.health()?
It's a built-in Elasticsearch API that returns the current health status of the cluster.

It gives you a high-level overview: green, yellow, or red.

ðŸ”¹ What do the health statuses mean?
Status	Meaning
Green :	  All primary and replica shards are allocated (everything is healthy).
Yellow:	  All primary shards are allocated, but one or more replicas are not.
Red   :  	One or more primary shards are not allocated (serious issue).
